Private Client Work & Freelancing Projects

Most of the commits visible in my GitHub activity are part of freelance and client-based projects.

Due to confidentiality agreements and NDA policies, these repositories are private and cannot be made public.

Although the source code is not publicly accessible, the commit history reflects my active involvement in real-world development, production-level features, and ongoing project maintenance.
